Git is a distibuted repository managment.

Git 3 stages in local before moving to centrol repository (GitHub)
Workspace area : Devloper create new file or modified the file then it will go to workspace
git status
Index (or) staging area : track the information in the logs. track id, author details.
git log
Local repository area : Which files are in local repository those files only we can push it into centrol repository.


Git useful commands:
Basic commands:
===============
git init  -- to initalze git repo
git config --global user,name "Satishc"
git config --global user.email "devops@gmail.com"
git config --list
touch file-name
example touch file.txt
git status : modified or newly created files are in which area. staging or index area.
git add file-name
git add file-name1 file-name2
git add .
git add *
git add -A
git commit -m "code changes added"
git reset head file-name
git rest --soft <Commit_id>    move the files from local areat to index or staging area.
git reset --mixed <Commit_id>  move the files from local area to workspace area.
git commit -m "code changes added" three.txt   modified files can commit directly from workspace to local area.  

git log               Logs will show the commit id,authore and date.
git log --oneline     Logs will display in one line.
git log -n            Logs will display n number of the commit information.
git log --oneline -n  Logs will display the short form(one line) and number of commits.
git log --author=<AUTHOR NAME>  Logs will display based on the author name
git log --since=yyyy-mm-dd      Logs will display since to now
git log --until=yyyy-mm-dd      Logs will display until
git log --since=yyyy-mm-dd --until=yyyy-mm-dd   logs from that from_date to to_date


Central repository commands :
============================
git clone <path of the central repository>  clone the repositry from the centrol to workspace.
git clone https://github.com/satishchjavastream/SQLCommands.git
git pull                      latest modifications pulled from the centrol repository to workspace
git pull origin <branch_name>
git push                      after commit (local repository code changes) pushed to centrol repository              
git push origin <branch-name>

Branch is nothing but a copy of the master repository data.
Branch commands:
================
git branch              Know the branch inforation. and highlate the select branch in green colour
git branch release-1    Creat a new branch
git checkout release-1  move from exist branch to new branch (example: release-1)
git merge release-1     merge the new files or modified files from release branch to master.so goto target branch (master branch) then merge the release-1 branch.
git branch -d release-1 delete the branch
git branch -D release-1 delete the branch forcefully.
git push origin master      push the code to master1 branch (local repository to centrol repository)
git push origin -d master1  delete the branch from centrol repository
rm file-name                delete the file from centrol repository

Merge conflicts resloution
==========================
Skip the merge. one step back
git merge --abort
How to slove the merge conflicts
------------------------------
Same file we modified in two different branchs and planing to merge the branch from one branch to two then we will see the merge conflict
master banch has a file1.txt,  Now modified the data in file1.txt
master1 branch has a file1.txt same way modified the data in file1.txt
Now we are planing to merge the master1 reposiroty to master. then we will observe that there will be a CONFLICT
-----------------------
SB-IN-5MJRPH2+Satish@SB-IN-5MJRPH2 MINGW64 /d/Learning/Git/gitPractice/practicegit (master)
$ git merge master1
Auto-merging file1.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file1.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

SB-IN-5MJRPH2+Satish@SB-IN-5MJRPH2 MINGW64 /d/Learning/Git/gitPractice/practicegit (master|MERGING)
$ vi file1.txt

SB-IN-5MJRPH2+Satish@SB-IN-5MJRPH2 MINGW64 /d/Learning/Git/gitPractice/practicegit (master|MERGING)
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

        both modified:   file1.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

SB-IN-5MJRPH2+Satish@SB-IN-5MJRPH2 MINGW64 /d/Learning/Git/gitPractice/practicegit (master|MERGING)
$ git add .

SB-IN-5MJRPH2+Satish@SB-IN-5MJRPH2 MINGW64 /d/Learning/Git/gitPractice/practicegit (master|MERGING)
$ git commit  -m "conflict file changes"
[master 246d193] conflict file changes

SB-IN-5MJRPH2+Satish@SB-IN-5MJRPH2 MINGW64 /d/Learning/Git/gitPractice/practicegit (master)



---------------

git diff file-Name        Check the modifications with in the same file .
git diff master master1   Check the difference between two branch files.
git cherry-pick 6dc0d20   move the particular file from one branch to another branch then use cherry-pick command

Stash memory
